# Blog-Website-Project

This is a project that showcases a mock blog website with a fictitious company name, Natural Living Today. 
The blog website contains three main pages: the home page, one blog post that can be accessed by clicking on a link on the home page, and an About Me page. 
The home page explores various blog posts about organic foods, herbal homeopathic remedies, natural bath and body products and so forth.
